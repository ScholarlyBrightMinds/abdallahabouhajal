                    <p>
                        Last week, a professor told me something that stuck with me: <em>"The more you know, the more you know that you don't know."</em> We were chatting about academia and life, and honestly, when I first heard it, I wasn't entirely sure what he meant. But then came last Saturday, and suddenly it all clicked.
                    </p>
                
                    <p>
                        I had the incredible opportunity to participate in <strong>BindHack</strong> at Insilico Medicine in Masdar City—a #drugdiscovery-meets-#AI hackathon that turned out to be one of the most collaborative and exciting experiences I've had in a while.
                    </p>

                    <h2>The Challenge: Build Fast, Learn Faster</h2>

                    <p>
                        Picture this: just six hours to build a model that predicts how well antibodies bind to antigens using their sequences and structures. Six hours! The clock was ticking from the moment we started, and the energy in the room was electric.
                    </p>

                    <h2>The Real Win: Teamwork Made the Dream Work</h2>

                    <p>
                        The most exciting part? Teaming up with brilliant minds from completely different backgrounds. Our team—<strong>Syafiq Kamarul Azman, Youssof Saleh, Noel Thomas, Shamma, and Aleks</strong>—brought such unique perspectives and skills to the table that we quickly found our rhythm.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Our strategy was simple but effective: talk ideas out, split into pairs, deliver what you can, and see what performs best. No egos, just pure collaboration. And guess what? Through focusing on choosing the right data and finding better representations (features)... we walked away with <strong>1st place! 🏆</strong> Massive kudos to everyone on Team 1!!
                    </p>

                    <h2>That Quote Finally Makes Sense</h2>

                    <p>
                        Looking back, that professor's quote hits differently now. In just six hours, I saw how much I still have to learn—about AI, about protein science, about teamwork. The more we dove into the problem, the more we realized how much we didn't know. And that wasn't discouraging—it was <em>exciting</em>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        That's the beauty of initiatives like this hackathon. They remind you that learning isn't about having all the answers, but about being curious enough to ask the right questions and humble enough to learn from others.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I'm incredibly glad I took part in this experience, and I'm looking forward to many more, inshallah!
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Tremendous appreciation to <strong>Insilico Medicine</strong> for the fantastic organization and warm hospitality, and a special thanks to <strong>Tatsiana Limarenka, Ilia, Andrew, and Simon</strong> for the guidance, spirit, and good vibes throughout the day.
                    </p>

                    <p>Here's to embracing what we don't know—and having fun discovering it together!</p>
