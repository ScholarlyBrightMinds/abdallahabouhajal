                    <p>
                    Lately, I’ve been thinking about what it really means to “go the distance.”
                    just To be clear first — the choice to do or not to do is always <b>momentary</b> 
                    I’ve seen plenty of excuses for myself: when the data doesn’t make sense, when progress feels invisible, or when you have to stay up for a very long time.
                    That’s when you start asking yourself, is it even worth it?
                    Well, I guess I’ve found my answer — for what it’s worth… I’ll go the distance.
                    </p>
                
                    <h2>What "The Distance" Means to Me</h2>
                    <p>
                    For me, “the distance” is when you push boundaries just to achieve a single thing — something you were advised to pursue, told it’s the future, or simply a vision you believed in
                    That’s exactly what happened to me. I finished my BPharm in Pharmacy, always aiming for an academic path and career. Later, I enrolled in a master’s program in Pharmaceutical Sciences. During that time, I was advised to explore AI — so I did. 
                    (That was right when ChatGPT had just launched — and I can’t thank the OpenAI team enough for that.)</p>
                    It was one hell of a journey, but absolutely worth it. 
                    <p>And am I still going the distance? Of course, I am.
                    Now, as a Managing Editor at Scifiniti Publishing, I’m surrounded by multiple journals, flood of articles, and a big chunk of responsibilities — yet I still find room to write, to research, and to keep growing.
                    Going the distance, for me, also means <b>building a website for myself</b>, pushing forward despite the packed schedule, and still finding ways to lift up the people around me.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       The excuses are always there, easy to find. But the real question is: would you go the distance?
                    </p>
                
                    <h2>My Simple Rule</h2>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Distance = Focus × Consistency × Buckling up!</strong>
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Focus:</strong> Fewer projects, deeper work. Say no to the noise.</li>
                        <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Show up—even when the model misbehaves, the assay fails, or the idea looks naïve.</li>
                        <li><strong>Buckling up:</strong> You gotta do what you gotta do. It’s about grit when it gets tough.</li>
                    </ul>
                
                    <blockquote>
                        The work gets easier when the path gets narrower.
                    </blockquote>
                
                
                    <p>
                        So, will I go the distance? Hell yeah, I would! Because tomorrow, I’ll take another step. You should trying the same .. trust me it feels so good eventually! 
                    </p>
