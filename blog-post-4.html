          <p>Okay, real talk. If you work in AI for drug discovery and you have not spent time on GitHub, you are missing the point.</p>

          <p>During the recent hackathon at Insilico Medicine and through a lot of my recent work, one thing kept showing up again and again. Code is now just as important as your paper.</p>

          <p>A predictive model in a publication is great.<br>
          A working GitHub repo that runs, explains, and evolves is better.<br>
          That is how real science moves forward. Transparency, sharing, and building on what came before.</p>

          <p>We have written an editorial that is in review showing how GitHub usage is exploding in drug discovery, with about a <strong>60% jump</strong> in publications that reference it from 2023 to 2024. That is wild.</p>

          <h2>Why GitHub matters for new researchers</h2>
          <p>In simple terms:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>You will run into it</li>
            <li>It looks confusing at first</li>
            <li>And yes, you will need it anyway</li>
          </ul>

          <p>The first time I opened a GitHub repo, it felt like walking into a foreign city with no map. Then the basics clicked:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>README.md</strong> is your guidebook. If it is clear, you are good. If it is vague, brace yourself.</li>
            <li><strong>Issues</strong> and <strong>pull requests</strong> are like lab meeting notes. This is where the real action happens.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>A simple GitHub workflow that works</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>1)</strong> Discover tools with clear keywords like ligand binding prediction or generative molecule design.</li>
            <li><strong>2)</strong> Assess the repo. Is it maintained? Is the documentation clear? Does it include Docker or Conda files?</li>
            <li><strong>3)</strong> Engage by running examples. Test it. Break it. See what happens when you tweak it.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>The goal is not just to use code. It is to understand it, reuse it, and improve it. That is how we move forward.</p>

          <h2>The bigger picture</h2>
          <p>Imagine this.<br>
          Every AI model in every paper backed by a clean, documented, reproducible GitHub repo.<br>
          That is the future we should aim for.</p>

          <p>If you are new to research or just getting started, open that repo. Clone that project. Break it, fix it, learn from it. It is all part of the process.</p>

          <p><strong>Happy coding and til next time</strong></p>
