                <section class="blog-content">
                    <p>Okay, real talk … if you’re working in AI for drug discovery and you haven’t spent time on GitHub... you’re kind of missing the whole point.</p>

                    <p>During the recent hackathon at Insilico Medicine (and through a lot of the work I’ve been doing lately), one thing kept showing up over and over: code is now just as important as your paper.</p>

                    <p>A predictive model in a publication is great.<br>
                    A working GitHub repo that runs, explains, and evolves? That’s better.<br>
                    That’s how real science moves forward. Or at least this is what I think. Transparency, sharing, and building on what came before.</p>

                    <p>In fact, we have written a full editorial (currently in review!) showing how GitHub is exploding in drug discovery, with around a <strong>60% jump</strong> in publications referencing it just from 2023 to 2024. That’s wild.</p>

                    <h2>So, Why Does GitHub Matter for New Researchers?</h2>
                    <p>Let me put it simply:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You will run into it</li>
                        <li>It’ll look confusing at first</li>
                        <li>And yep — you’ll need it anyway</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>The first time I opened a GitHub repo, it felt like walking into a foreign city with no map. But then I started figuring out the basics:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>README.md</strong> is your guidebook. If it’s clear, you're good. If it’s vague, brace yourself.</li>
                        <li><strong>Issues</strong> and <strong>pull requests</strong>? Think of them as lab meeting notes — this is where the real action happens.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>A Simple GitHub Workflow (that actually works)</h2>
                    <p>We talk about this in the editorial, but here’s a quick preview:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>🔍 Discover tools using clear keywords like “ligand binding prediction” or “generative molecule design.”</li>
                        <li>🧪 Assess the repo — is it maintained? Clear documentation? Docker or Conda files?</li>
                        <li>⚙️ Engage by running examples. Test it. Break it. See what happens when you tweak it.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>The idea isn’t just to use code — it’s to understand it, reuse it, and maybe improve it. That’s how we move forward.</p>

                    <h2>The Bigger Picture</h2>
                    <p>Imagine this:<br>
                    Every AI model in every paper, backed by a clean, documented, reproducible GitHub repo.<br>
                    That’s the future we should aim for.</p>

                    <p>So if you’re new to research or just getting started in this space, go ahead, open that repo. Clone that project. Break it, fix it, learn from it. It’s all part of the process.</p>

                    <p><strong>Happy coding and til next time!</strong></p>
